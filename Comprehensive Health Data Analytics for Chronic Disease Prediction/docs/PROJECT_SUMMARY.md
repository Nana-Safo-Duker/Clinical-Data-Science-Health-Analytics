# Project Summary

## Overview

This project provides a comprehensive analysis of cardiovascular disease prediction using health data. The analysis is implemented in both Python and R, providing flexibility for different user preferences and use cases.

## Key Features

1. **Comprehensive Statistical Analysis**
   - Descriptive statistics for all variables
   - Inferential statistics (t-tests, chi-square tests)
   - Correlation analysis
   - Exploratory data analysis

2. **Univariate, Bivariate, and Multivariate Analysis**
   - Univariate: Distribution analysis of individual variables
   - Bivariate: Relationships between two variables
   - Multivariate: Relationships among multiple variables

3. **Comprehensive EDA**
   - Data quality assessment
   - Outlier detection and analysis
   - Distribution analysis
   - Target variable analysis
   - Feature engineering insights

4. **Machine Learning Analysis**
   - Multiple ML algorithms (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, XGBoost, LightGBM, SVM)
   - Model evaluation and comparison
   - Feature importance analysis
   - Hyperparameter tuning

## Project Structure

- **Python Implementation**: Notebooks and scripts for Python analysis
- **R Implementation**: Scripts and notebooks for R analysis
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive README and setup guides
- **Results**: Generated figures and analysis results

## Dataset

The dataset contains 70,000 records with 14 features including:
- Demographic information (age, gender, height, weight)
- Health metrics (blood pressure, cholesterol, glucose)
- Lifestyle factors (smoking, alcohol, physical activity)
- Target variable: Cardiovascular disease presence

## Analysis Workflow

1. **Data Loading and Cleaning**: Preprocess and clean the dataset
2. **Statistical Analysis**: Perform descriptive and inferential statistics
3. **Univariate Analysis**: Analyze individual variables
4. **Bivariate Analysis**: Examine relationships between two variables
5. **Multivariate Analysis**: Explore relationships among multiple variables
6. **Comprehensive EDA**: Deep dive into the data
7. **Machine Learning**: Build and evaluate predictive models
