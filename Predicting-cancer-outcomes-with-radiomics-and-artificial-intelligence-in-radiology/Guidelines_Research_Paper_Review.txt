Step-by-Step Guideline 


Step 1: Thoroughly Read the Research Paper - https://www.nature.com/articles/s41571-021-00560-7

First Reading: 
●	Skim the paper to grasp the overall topic and structure. 

Second Reading: 

●	Read in detail, taking notes on key points, methodologies, results, and conclusions. 
Please answer: 
1.	Why did you choose this research paper? Reflect how this paper is relevant for your academic/ career goal. 
2.	What is the main problem or question the research addresses? 
3.	Why is this problem significant in bioinformatics? 
4.	What are the authors' objectives or hypotheses? 
 







Step 2: Describe the Background and Context 
 
Explain the context of the research using the knowledge you’ve learned in research ethics, cloud computing, and omics-data.   
Please answer: 
1.	What background information is necessary to understand the study? 
2.	How does this research fit into the existing body of knowledge? 
3.	Are there any previous studies or theories it builds upon or challenges? 






  
Step 3: Examine the Methodology 
 
Justify your reasoning using concepts in AI/ML or the statistical/visualization techniques you’ve learned, such as mean, median, standard deviation, T-test, P-value.  
 
Examples:  
1) A T-test was used to compare the mean gene expression levels between two treatment groups because it allows for straightforward hypothesis testing on differences of means. 
2) The team considered both PCA and t-SNE for dimensionality reduction. PCA was ultimately chosen due to its interpretability and linear assumptions, which aligned better with the dataset’s characteristics. 
Please answer: 
1.	What methods or techniques were used to conduct the research? 
2.	Why were these methods chosen over others? 
3.	What data sources were utilized, and how was the data collected and processed? 
4.	Were any tools or software specifically important for the study? 






 
Step 4: Evaluate the Results 
 
Explain your reasoning using skills in Python, R, concepts in AI/ML, omics data, or statistical tools you’ve learned, such as mean, median, standard deviation, T-test, P-value. 
Please answer: 
1.	What were the key findings of the research? 
2.	How do the results support the initial hypotheses or objectives? 
3.	Were there any surprising or unexpected outcomes? 
4.	How do these results contribute to the field of bioinformatics? 
5.	If you plan to generate or replicate a figure to back up your argument: 
a.	Choose at least one that clearly illustrates whether the research achieved its primary goals or validated the hypotheses. 
b.	Prioritize ones that highlight breakthrough data, reveal novel patterns, or emphasize important trends relevant to the study's conclusions. 
c.	Include the code with clear comments/ annotation 







Step 5: Discuss the Implications 
Please answer: 
1.	What conclusions did the authors draw from their findings? 
2.	What are the practical or theoretical implications of the results? 
3.	How might this research influence future studies or applications in bioinformatics? 
4.	Did the authors mention any limitations or areas for future research?
